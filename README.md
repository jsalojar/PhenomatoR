PhenomatoR: An R Package for the Analysis of Large-Scale Phenomics Data

Authors: Stephanie Fernandez and Michael Wrzaczek and Jarkko Saloj√§rvi.

With the recent introduction of automated high-throughput phenomics platforms, plant phenotyping is enterering into a new era. The platforms make it possible to do accurate phenotyping of thousands of individuals, facilitating the mapping of QTLs and identifying the effects of gene knockouts on the phenotype. However, it is difficult to make all the heterogeneous data from different phenotyping variables commeasurable. We are developing an R toolbox aimed for standardizing the data and comparing the phenotypic variation against internal controls. The package can use the output of most commercial phenotyping platforms.
